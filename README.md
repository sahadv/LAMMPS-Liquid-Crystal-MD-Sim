# LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics of Liquid Crystalline Order
## Description 

###
- One of the most important parameters to measure for Liquid crystals (LCs), the key material comprising LCD screens, is their overall molecular order. 
Often this is done by doping the LC with a liquid crystal dye, but _can this doping process negatively affect the doping overall molecular order?_
- We studied this from a molecular dynamics perspective using the common rod-shaped LC called 5CB and the LC dye perylene.
- Included is a LAMMPS code the MDsim, and the Python script used to calculate the overall molecular order (the Order Parameter)
